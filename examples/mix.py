=================================
Cross-FuzzyEn of MIX(p) Processes
=================================

Calculates the cross-FuzzyEn between two different pairs of MIX(p) processes
across exponential function widths. The intention is to replicate Figure 3a of
Xie et al. 2010 ("Cross-Fuzzy Entropy: A New Method to Test Pattern Synchrony
of Bivariate Time Series").

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : float
       Randomness of the process. Technically, it is the probability of drawing
       a sample from a uniform distribution rather than a deterministic
       sinusoid. If 0, a sinusoid is generated.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape. Default is None, in which case a single value is
        returned.
